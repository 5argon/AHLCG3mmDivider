# Collection based on Collector Number Range (CNR)

![CNR](./Images/cnr-1.jpg)

This was my previous organization, now I have shifted to [Cycle-Class-Quantity (CCQ)](./cycle-class-quantity.md).

Collector Number is the number on the bottom right of the card. These numbers do not clash within the same expansion, so first, each divider must represent 1 expansion by the use of expansion icon.

Then it make a "reasonably sized range" of consecutive Collector Number in that expansion and make a divider for each. Whether in that range is "neat" or not is unfortunately depends :

- Revised Core Set : The first chunk of product has the same class in chunks, then it goes to encounter cards which we have no business with, **but** it then came back to the bonus cards starting from Guardian again (183-195). This last chunk is unfortunately "rainbow".
- Everything before Edge of the Earth : Consecutive Collector Number corresponds to the old Mythos Pack release model, so unfortunately all the chunks are rainbow in order to have consecutive Collector Number.
- Edge of the Earth, Scarlet Keys onwards : With the seperation of Investigator Expansion box, we now have the same class color inside a chunk of consecutive Collector Number again like the Revised Core Set. Multi-class cards in Edge of the Earth got additionally chunked further though as otherwise the multi-class chunk would be too big.

Organizing by CNR maybe easy to locate the card when you built the deck via ArkhamDB since you can order by the number. But putting back in the correct spot maybe a problem if you would like everything ordered from low to high inside that chunk.

And in my opinion this kind of ordering has high "collector" value because it show off how complete and orderly your collection is. And it is more suited to binders instead of box format, which we won't need the dividers in the first place!

Personally I think [Cycle-Class-Quantity (CCQ)](./cycle-class-quantity.md) is superior in box format. But since I already made everything in CNR I think maintaining this line of dividers won't be too much of an additional work for me.
