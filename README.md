# AH:LCG 3mm Dividers

This repository hosts a Unity project that is used to generate [The 3mm Divider](https://arkham-starter.com/divider) graphics. They are for organizing Arkham Horror: The Card Game collection. 

If you just want to download and print the dividers, visit the [main project page](https://arkham-starter.com/divider) instead. If you would like to contribute translations or new language, they are also explained in that page.

But if you want to mess with the generator of those graphics, this is the right place! However currently there is no documentation just yet. If you have experience with Unity game engine, you can try opening the `Unity` folder with Unity and mess around.
