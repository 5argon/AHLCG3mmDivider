# Print and Play

This folder is not related with the 3mm dividers, I just need somewhere to host these and I think this repo is the best location for me.

## Contents

These are all based on A4 size paper printing. After clicking PDF link, press the Downlaod button inside.

### Smaller Print and Play

Player cards from all 5 parallel investigator set plus some taboo cards of core set, Dunwich, and Carcosa.

But these are **smaller**, an intention is so you can print on thin paper and slot it in front of genuine sleeved card, to get the best experience possible if you don't have access to playing card printing service. If these cards were original size, sometimes the edge would poke out from the side and it would reveal the card while faced down in the deck.

To get the "correct smaller size", print all these on A4 paper. Final result will be about ~1 mm smaller from each side.

This is how smaller overlay looks like on the front, compared with the original. I also used 4 mm paper corner punch which the radius is a bit bigger than official cards.

These are all overlaid on spare Flashlight, Emergency Cache, and Knife.

### Parallel Investigators

5 parallel investigators, Mutated Rex Murphy (in smaller size for overlay, and original size), and remaining space filled with Promo Parallel Daisy and Skids. Original size FFG provided is 62.5mm x 88.7 mm. Print on A4 with no scaling to get this size.

Each one is stuck in pair, so you can either fold or cut them if you want to play with mixed front/back of that investigator.

Here is an example of finished print. I also used 4mm paper corner punch which the radius is a bit bigger than official cards.

### Timing and Gameplay

Extremely small reference card of the slightly enlarged flow chart from the rule book. Used to remember where are all the Player Window in between steps. The `x4` file will get you 4 double-sided reference cards in one A4.

### Box-fitted campaign logs

These are from official FFG online campaign PDF, but stripped out only the last few pages with the log, centered on A4 paper, and scale down such that after cutting white area out on the printed A4, it fits back in the revised core set box/new format campaign box. (Accounting for 1 cm laminate padding each side of the log.)

Print in color then laminate it, then you can use non-permanent markers (wash with water, such as white barrel Staedtler Lumocolor) to reuse the colored log over and over. [This Night of the Zealot log (NotZ spoiler in this image)](https://github.com/5argon/AHLCG3mmDivider/blob/main/PrintAndPlay/Images/laminated-log.jpg?raw=true) was used for about 4 replays and it cleaned up very well with no trace of the previous play.
